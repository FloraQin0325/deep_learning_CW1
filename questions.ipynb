    "2. As the ouput unit activation functions, the sigmoid and tanh intervals are 0 to 1, or -1 to 1 respectively, meaning that these two functions have an advantage in expression of the output layer. Besides that, the vanishing gradients problem is caused by the largest gradient of sigmoid function is 0.25 and all gradients on each layer multiply to nearly zero. If we only use the sigmoid as output unit activation function, we may not encounter with vanishing gradients problem.\n",
